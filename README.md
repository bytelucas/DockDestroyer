# DockDestroyer
Because sometimes `killall` doesn't quite cut it.

This Mac App simply makes it really easy to force your Dock to shut down when it's not behaving, by sending a level 9 kill command to the PID of your Dock. I've created this because sometimes my Dock does not play nicely with uBar (a dock replacement app I use), so this just makes my life a whole lot easier.

Feel free to look through the source code, or fetch the latest .dmg here: https://github.com/bytelucas/DockDestroyer/releases/latest
